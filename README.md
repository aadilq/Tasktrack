# Tasktrack

Tasktrack is a simple Task management project that I made in order to learn more about typescript, specifically type safety and reusable functions. For example, I was able to create an interface called Task which allowed me to define the structure of task objects and within that interface, I was able to use type assertions state a specific type of a value.

## Lessons Learned

Before coming into this project, my knowledge of Typescript was limited in the sense that I had never worked with it before so while working on this project, I did find myself going through different websites like GeeksforGeeks to explain the little syntatical differences that existed between Typescript and Javascript. One challenge that I did face was actually getting my typescript code to run and so I found out after some researching that TypeScript code has transpiled into JavaScript for the browser to interpret, enabling browsers to read and display the code.
